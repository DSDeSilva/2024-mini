Exercise 1:
max_bright value was 5315. 
min_bright value was 22485.

Exercise 2:
We modified the code to play the song, "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star".

Exercise 3:

Part 1:
You missed the light 2 / 10 times
Average response time: 263.375 ms
Minimum response time: 229 ms
Maximum response time: 344 ms
[247, 280, 344, 233, 267, 262, 245, 229]

Part 2:

This game requires the user to hit the button after the LED flashes. We modified the code so that the game is 10 flashes instead of 3. We also wrote code to upload the game data (user's results) to an online server. To do this, we also had to add code that connected the raspberry pi to the user's laptop hotspot. We chose to use ThingSpeak as our online server as it offers some nice visualization tools which we utilized to display our data, as shown by the screenshots below.
